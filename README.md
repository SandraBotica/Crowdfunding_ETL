# Crowdfunding_ETL

In the <ETL_Mini_Project_SBotica.ipynb> file you will find the following:

1.  
The Category and Sub_category DataFrames created.
The two DataFrames <category.csv> and <subcategory.csv> files have been exported to the Resources folder.

2.
The Campaign DataFrame was created.
The <campaign.csv> file was exported to the Resources folder.

3.
To create the Contacts DataFrame I chose Option 1.
The <contacts.csv> file was exported to the Resources folder.

4.
The Crowdfunding Database was created using QUICK DBD.
An image of the ERD used to create the schema is in the Resources folder.
The file is <QuickDBD_Project1.png>
The database schema is saved in Resources as <crowdfunding_db_schema.sql>
A Postgres(pgAdmin4)database was created called <crowdfunding_db>
Tables were created, verified with a SELECT statement and CSV files imported to each table.
A select statement was run for each table to check the correct data was running.

A check of these select statement was also run after option 1 in the <ETL_Mini_Project_SBotica.ipynb> to check if select statements were extracting correct data.
